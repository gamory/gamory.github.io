I haven't been up to much interesting lately.  Lots of woodwork mostly.  I do have some ideas for some RFID testing though, so hopefully i'll have something interesting to report on there.  If it doesn't end up working on the 
other hand, i'll probably never type up anything on it.  
  
I'm starting to learn some about Amazon AWS services.  I went to a security conference last week (Red Sky Conference 2019), and it came up a lot.  The company I work for doesn't make much use of it currently, but I wouldn't be 
shocked to see higher use in the future.  May as well start learning before there is a "trial by fire".
