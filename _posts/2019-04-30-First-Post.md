Although I have a (very rudimentary) blog at my actual website (kainresearch.com), it's broken, and woefully out of date anyway.  
  
So, I decided that since I spend more time on Github lately anyway, this would be a good way to do things.  Don't expect much though, because i've never been good at it.  It's really common for me to go months or years without anything to mention.  I'll try to put anything interesting or pertinent here though.
