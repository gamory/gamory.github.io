I'm a computer guy living in South Jordan, UT.  My day job is Network Security Administrator, but i've previously also done:  
Programming (in a few languages)  
Help desk  
Enterprise Operations  
Network Administration (some, but not an expert)  
Freelance computer repair and builds  
  
As far as hobbies, I enjoy getting away from the computer:  
Wood turning  
Making wooden and acrylic pens  
General woodwork  
Rudimentary metalwork  
Rudimentary welding (MIG)  
Playing chess poorly  
Locksport  
Playing with my pretty respectable synthesizer collection  
Music production  
  
Feel free to contact me with questions.
